プロンプト:

```prompt
Imagine a landscape in an alien dimension with a gradient of soft brown to lighter shades of orange and red, extending the atmosphere beyond traditional concepts. The scene is slightly darker to create a more mysterious atmosphere. It is filled with floating windows displaying futuristic code and diagrams, and engineering tools such as wrenches, screwdrivers, and pliers spread widely across and beyond the visible frame, some embedded into the ground. Among these, two to three gears are fully materialized, appearing solid and tangible amidst the ethereal environment. These materialized gears symbolize the advanced technology field, seamlessly integrated with nature, some embedded into the ground. The minimalist 3D designed house remains subtly placed, blending with the surreal, tech-infused, darker setting.
